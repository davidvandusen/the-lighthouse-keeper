# Log: Slash and Splash

The party is free to go from the storm giant shrine in the Greypeak Mountains. The roads are clear because all creatures
fear the giants and don't want to get in their way. Taking advantage of this, the party quickly and safely journeys back
to Harbour Town.

Once in town, they immediately go to the marketplace to sell their loot and to find the weapon smiths who offered to
silver their weapons if brought the materials. The first stop is the jeweler, Norfalcon Milner, who specializes in 
magical rings. He tells about a very fortunate order he received last year from Corerris, the half-orc sea captain.
Corerris is known to be interested in some resources in the reef archipelago to the northwest of Harbour Town. The reef
is the domain of the aquatic elves, who appear to be bolstering their amory.

Belben Shortcloak, one of the weapon smiths that the party met earlier enters the jeweler's shop and adds to the
conversation that the aquatic elves have put in an order for tridents from their shop. He invites the party to their
shop to discuss the silvering of their weapons.

When they arrive at the shop they are thanked by the other two weapon smiths who the party saved from the pirates. Then
a clanging noise is heard from the store room behind the workshop. Candor goes to check it out.

## Battle: Animated tridents

Strangely, several of the tridents fly into the air and start swinging at the party. Additionally, a suit of armor,
which the weapon smiths didn't know was even in their store room, also comes to life and starts attacking. The party
does what they can to break the weapons and armor.

## Investigating the markings

On the broken tridents, they find some markings which appear to be elvish script, but in another language. After
investigation, these markings appear to be part of a spell to animate and command the weapons. The party inquires of the
weapon smiths who did this. They have no idea how the markings could have gotten there, but one of the aquatic elves was
there earlier in the day to check on the order. Feeling fearful, decided to close up shop right away.

## Tracking the culprit

Behind the workshop is a water channel that leads from the ocean into a brick tunnel that flows under the city. These
tunnels are used to transport goods throughout the town. The party follows some webbed footprints that enter the water
in the direction of the tunnel.

Some way into the tunnel the party find themselves blocked by a portcullis. Kvothe transforms into a spider, climbs to
the other side, and the transforms back into himself to pull the switch to raise it.

On the other side of the portcullis is a room where several waterways converge. At the other end of the room is a boat
that looks like a dried up leaf. Kvothe swims over to it to investigate and finds what looks like an aquatic elf 
cowering behind it.

## Battle: Sahuagin priestess and minions

The party is then attacked by a sahuagin priestess, a sahuagin, and a reef shark. The aquatic elf reveals itself to be
a malenti &mdash; a sahuagin who has mutated to appear like their hated enemy, the aquatic elves.

The sahuagins are fearsome warriors, but have little defense against the party's weapons and magic.

## Cleaning up the soggy mess

After killing all their foes, the party goes to investigate the boat and bodies. Gizmo finds a potion of healing on the
sahuagin priestess, and nothing else. In the boat the party finds some non-elvish writing in elvish script written on
a soggy sheet of seaweed. Gizmo uses comprehend languages to read as much as he can of it. It is instructions written in
the sahuagin language telling the recipient who to talk to in town and how to enchant the tridents and armor in the
weapon smiths store.

Also in the boat is a small purse of copper coins. Then, further investigation reveals that the boat has a false bottom
which contains a pointed hat made of woven aquatic plants.

Finally the party decides that they need more information from the dead sahuagins and put the malenti's body into the 
boat and ferries them out of the tunnel. They will look for a temple in town where speak with dead can be performed so 
that they can ask questions to the corpses.
