# I'm Talkin' About Shaft

Kvothe, Candor, and Carric find themselves rising slowly on a platform going up inside a dark shaft. Hornianus is there
and seems to have malicious intent. After an exchange of choice questions, Hornianus seems unimpressed by the group and 
vanishes upon being attacked. The platform stops rising and they are trapped at the bottom of a very deep hole.

## Planting a bean

Kvothe plants one of the beans he found earlier and a beanstalk starts to grow very quickly. In addition to the vines
clinging to the walls, mushrooms start to sprout around them. Each adventurer eats a mushroom, but only one of them
feels any benefit from it, and the others become sick.

## Battle: Cave fisher

Then, digging up through the platform comes a cave fisher. They battle and defeat it, and afterwards realize that its
body and web could be quite valuable, so they throw it in the portable hole.

## Climbing out

By this point the beanstalk seems to have grown all the way up and out of the hole. They take one last look around at
the bottom and find three blue, translucent eggs. Satisfied that that's all to find, they start climbing out.

## Battle: Flame skull

As they near the top, a green light flashes over the exit of the hole, then drops down. It's a flaming skull and it
attacks them.

After destroying the flame skull, they begin to pull themselves out of the hole at the top. Carric gets little more than
his head above ground before he notices the cleric they had met in the fields outside of town holding a drawn bow 
pointed at his face.

## Rewards

- Experience from defeated enemies: 1800 (divided by 3 adventurers, 600 each)
- Experience for escaping the hole: 100 each
- Treasure: 3 blue eggs
- Spoils: cave fisher corpse and web
- Downtime days: 5
