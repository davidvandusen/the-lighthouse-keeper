The party arrives back at the hideout of the Zhentarim and deliver the universal solvent. They are rewarded with 
replacements for their silvered weapons.

The solvent is used to make a magical compass functional by unsticking its needle. This compass will be used to guide
them to a magical item that is extremely important to The Mare.

Very early the next morning, the party sets sail along with Corgan and Dachs toward wherever the compass takes them.

## Battle: Whale of a storm

The first day and a half of sailing is calm, but a sudden storm overtakes them. The strength of the storm knocks both
Corgan and Dachs off the boat and the party must save them. During the rescue, a killer whale attacks the members in the
water. The boat sustains some damage due to rams by the whale, but eventually everyone gets back on the boat and the
whale is slain.

Gizmo uses his magic to mend the damage to the boat as best he can and the party continues toward their destination.

As the party arrives at the island that the compass directed them to, they drop anchor some distance from the shore
due to the craggy rocks that surround it. They use their foldable boat to get to the shore.

Some evidence exists on the shore to suggest that this island is inhabited. The company marches in the direction of the
compass along a forest path.

## Battle: Kuo-Toa whipped

Upon hearing whispers in the woods around themselves, Gizmo casts comprehend languages on himself. The whispers talk of
protection and removing the invaders. Then nets are cast from the trees and a battle ensues. Several kuo-toas attack the
party, but clearly have no intent to kill. The party is not so merciful and ends their assailants.
