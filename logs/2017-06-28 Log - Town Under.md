# Town Under 

Not feeling particularly trapped in their locked room, Carric, Candor, and Kvothe take a long rest. In the morning,
Hornianus, the mayor's clerk, brings breakfast. Discussing their best option with him, they decide to escape. First,
they compose a polite letter to the mayor, thanking him for his hospitality. Then, they open up the floor underneath one
of the beds and descend into the river that flows under the mayor's manor.

## Littler riddler

While following the water downstream, the party comes across a gnomish man fishing in the river next to a smoking house.
He immediately asks to play a riddle guessing game with the adventurers. When they successfully guess his riddle about
water, he offers them each a water breathing potion and some smoked fish.

## A sinking feeling

A little further down the path, there is a sinkhole that much of the river water is going down. With little 
contemplation, the party takes their new water breathing potions and descend into the sinkhole. As they swim downward
they begin to feel pulled downward. They go with the flow and are ejected onto a natural slide that drops them off onto
a platform of rock in a gargantuan cavern.

With their darkvision, the party can just barely make out that on the ceiling of the cavern is covered in what look like
buildings made of stone. This becomes more clear as the ascend some stairs that they discovered along the side of the
cavern wall. Once near the top, Carric, with the best vision of all, discerns that the buildings on the ceiling are
indeed a mirror image of the town above. And there seem to be flying creatures presently building them.

## Battle: Gargoyles

As they gaze upward, two of the winged creatures swoop down to attack them. The monsters appear much like stone 
gargoyles, but are able to fly with their stone wings. The party is taken aback but still prevail in this encounter.
Carric finds six onyx in the stomach of one of the crushed stone monsters.

## Flighty light

In need of rest, they continue up the staircase to a cave. Inside the cave is a lantern. When they approach the lantern
it scurries away. Unable to capture it, and fairly sure it's not being carried by an invisible foe, they decide to rest.

When they awake, the search to find a chimney at the back of the cave. They crawl upwards in this space to find 
themselves at the door of one of the upsidedown structures. The lantern follows as they go.

They enter into the house via the second story window and then clamber up the staircase to the main floor. On its 
ceiling a pouch of beads of force lay.

## Battle: Ooze and imps

Just then an ochre jelly oozes out of the wall. It doesn't move quickly, but it startles the party. Candor throws one of
the force beads at it and it falls dead through a hole it blows in the floor.

The party are still under attack, though, but by invisible enemies. Two imps are inside the house and they want the 
party gone. When one of them attacks and becomes visible, Candor tries to ask why they are attacking. The imp replies 
that they will "ruin the master's plan."

The lamp shines brightly and illuminates the room. Its light also reveals the invisible imp. When the party attacks
it, it flees along with the other imp.

Then, all goes eerily quiet.
