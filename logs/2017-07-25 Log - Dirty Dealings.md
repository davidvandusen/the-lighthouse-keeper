# Dirty Dealings

Welcomed aboard Correrris' ship, Gizmo, Gavlan, and Power settle in somewhat. They learn a bit about the way the ship is
run, and the sailors seem to be happy working on it. Apparently the fog wall near the ship is magical and hides the 
island that the bronze dragon is on. They will need some help to navigate through it.

Before turning in for the night, Gavlan goes to make himself known to the crew. He challenges a burly orc named Bashag
to an arm wrestle and loses terrifically. Bashag finds this humorous and welcomes Gavlan and the party to the ship. The
party goes to sleep in the guest quarters.

Early in the morning, Correrris asks Power to come to her quarters. Apparently she is not able to attune to the scepter
and suspects that Power is the only one who will be able to. She insists he try to attune to it.

Gavlan is then beckoned to the decks by Bashag who has a challenge for him. He is asked to hoist a rope back on deck.
He does so with ease and finds that it is a practical joke as initiation for coming aboard the ship.

Gizmo is then found by Enigrim Zippersnapper, the wizard gnome. They go to discuss spells they've been working on and
are quite thrilled by each other's abilities.

In Correrris' quarters, Power has attuned to the scepter and tries to use it on Xor the goblin butler. After several
attempts at penetrating Xor's mental armour, Power manages to command him with the scepter, confirming Correrris'
suspicion.

They go back on deck and are met with a summons by a sea hag that lives on an island nearby. Correrris doesn't want to
send her own crew to the summons, so she asks if the party will go instead. They agree and a longboat is prepared.

As the party gets ready for their mission, Enigrim offers some magical items to help them on their way. To Gizmo he
gives a three foot by ten foot portable hole. To Power he gives a scroll of the forcecage spell. To Gavlan he gives a
potion of supreme healing.

The party takes their offerings and board the boat. They are guided by merrow toward where the sea hag lives. The next
morning, they arrive at a sort of island, but there is no land and instead it grows like a swamp adrift at sea. They
row as far as they can into it and then start walking about on the island.

They notice as they go that various patches of moss show them a sort of pathway. Unfortunately each of them see a 
different pathway, so it can be of little use to follow explicitly.

# Battle: Meenlocks

As they wander in one direction, they are plagued with fearsome visions. Then they are attacked by three meenlocks who
are placing the visions in their heads. After the meenlocks are killed, the visions fade.

It's at that moment that they have an epiphany about the pathways on the moss, and come to understand the pathway it's
trying to communicate.

They follow the pathway between three structures on the island. At the first structure is an unlit brazier held aloft
on stilts above the marsh. They light it and green flames burst out.

# Battle: Will o' wisps

They head to the second structure and Gizmo spies a will o' wisp passing through. He shoots a firebolt at it and it
attacks along with a second wisp. Power has a close call after being zapped quite badly, but he pulls through and the
wisps are banished.

Investigating around the structure, another brazier is found and lit. Also, four metal bracelets on a chain are found in
a muddy hole.

The group continues on to the third structure. They find a third brazier and light it. Then in the distance a light 
comes on inside a stone hut.

They go in to find an old hag who wants to bargain with them. She says she will help guide Correrris' ship to the island
of the bronze dragon in exchange for ten pounds of its dragon scales, given willfully from the dragon. Once the deal is
made she disappears and the party makes their way back to their boat, and row, guided by merrow again, back to the ship.
