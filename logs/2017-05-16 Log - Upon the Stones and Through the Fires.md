# Log: Upon the Stones

Ready for a new adventure, the party heads back down the mountain to go to the next cache. Along the way, at the request
of Kvothe, they track down a bear cave. Upon finding the cave of a huge brown bear, Kvothe stealthily observes it until
he is certain he could transform into its shape.

They leave the bear dwelling and head to the road, where they encounter friends, new and old. Taklinn, the dwarf ranger
they met at The Lighthouse Keeper, is travelling with Random, a tiefling wizard, to investigate news regarding Veradda
Stoor's mission. The party informs these two of her death and their mission to find the treasure caches based on her
notes. They join the party and they start heading toward the stone pyramid.

## Battle: Giant badgers

As the stone pyramid comes into sight, five giant badgers spring out of cracks in the ground and attack the party. The
badgers wear collars and were probably put here to protect something. The badgers prove no match for the party, and they
proceed cautiously toward to pyramid.

## Inside and out

The pyramid is made of boulders that are being held together by magic. There are no entrances. The party decides to
scale the pyramid to see what's on the top. After a couple falls they make it to the very top.

They are surprised by a few things when they get there. One is that some of the boulders are galeb duhr. The other is
that the entrance on the top is plugged by a dead giant. In conversation with the galeb duhr, they learn a few things
about the situation, and also help out one of the stone elementals.

They extract the dead giant from the hole and determine that it suffered a huge amount of necrotic damage. They find on
its body a scroll of comprehend languages and take out a large silver nose ring.

There is a riddle to solve in order to enter the pyramid without taking damage. The party makes some effort to solve the
puzzle, and eventually makes their way into the pyramid alive.

Inside the pyramid they find it had been looted via a tunnel by some kobolds working for a band of giants. The only
remaining thing of worth is a book of names of cult members that was expertly extracted from a trapped chest by Gizmo.

## Rewards

- Experience for gaining entrance to the pyramid: 25 each

# Log: Through the Fires

Eager to get the jump on the bandits before they pillage the next cache, the adventurers go directly to the fourth cache
at the abandoned dwarven outpost. The road leading to the mountain entrance is in ruins from age, but there are fresh
tracks leading into the cave.

## Battle: Kobolds

Upon entering, the party finds ten kobolds barricading themselves against some fearsome thing in a further room. They
see the party entering behind them and attack in a panic. The party attempts (not wholly successfully) to spare and 
question them instead of massacre them.

## Questioning the kobolds

The kobolds say that they were sent by the fire giants to find the treasure in this outpost. When they entered the next
room they were attacked by fire monsters so they fled. The party pities the kobolds and sets them free. One offers a
scroll of disguise self in return.

The party goes to look into the next room to investigate what the kobolds were so afraid of and then sees a mass of
flame, shrouded by smoke, walking toward them.

## Rewards

- Experience for defeated enemies: 250 (divided by 6 adventurers, ~45 each)
- Spoils: scroll of disguise self
