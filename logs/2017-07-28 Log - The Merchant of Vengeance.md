# The Merchant of Vengeance

## Battle: Zanaver Duskwaller and deranged cultists

Before any reasonable communication can be done, the party finds themselves in battle against the field cleric, Zanaver
Duskwaller, and two cultists. The party kills both cultists and knocks out Zanaver. Carric takes Zanaver's bow, which
seems to have some magical power.

## Questioning the cleric

After resting, the party interrogates the cleric. They grow some trust for him as he agrees that he also wants what's
best for Harbour Town, and agree to let him live if he guides them back to the mayor's manor so they can go in and get
to the bottom of this conspiracy.

## The path to redemption

Zanaver takes the party to the secret entrance to the mayor's manor which leads directly to the treasury, then they part
ways. 

The pathway leads to a circular room with high ceilings. After some investigation, there seems to be some sort of
elevator system for getting to the hatches on the ceiling. They manage to find a way to use the elevator platforms and
enter a hatch above.

There doesn't seem to be any way down. They are in a dark, low-ceiling, cuboid room with a sort of chimney going up and
out. They can hear some stirring above and hide in the shadows.

A rope ladder is lowered down the chimney and a reluctant person is being sent down to investigate. Once he reaches the
bottom of the ladder, the boy, a wizard's apprentice, is startled and lets loose a firebolt which singes Carric.

Kvothe hold the boy and Candor disguises himself as him and goes to climb up the ladder.
