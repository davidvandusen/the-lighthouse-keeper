# Horrible Night To Have A Curse

![Waxing gibbous](http://quanyindivination.com/wp-content/themes/quanyindivination/images/moon-30.png)

It is mid-afternoon and the party is near enough to town that they decide to go and do some shopping. The gathered
silver is taken to the weapon smiths so that their weapons may be silvered.

After shopping the party goes to the docks to find an inn where they can sleep. Carric does not go with them, but rather
goes to the barracks of the soldiers who protect this town. Candor instead goes to ply his noble influence in the town
to get more information or perhaps favours.

## Battle: The Curious Case of the Werewolf in the Nighttime

Sleeping at an inn on the boardwalk, Gizmo is woken by darts hurled inexpertly at his pillow. Three shadowy figures go
on to attack the party as they sleep in their beds. Kvothe absconds the first moment he gets. The remainder of the party
are overpowered by the attackers, who are made up of a werewolf, wererat, and a half-elf who appears to be an underling
of the other two.

During the battle, Gizmo is bitten by the werewolf and becomes cursed with lycanthropy.

## Hold your horses

The party of Gavlan, Power, and Gizmo are bound and piled in the corner of one of the rooms. Then an intimidating figure
arrives. She transforms from a horse-human hybrid shape to the shape of a very tall human woman will a long node and a
mane of hair. She introduces herself as The Mare, and tells the party that they put up a good fight, and they, in
addition to Ranryn, the half-elf among the attackers, have proven themselves.

She explains that the Zhentarim are taking over Harbour Town and she is willing to recruit the party if they wish for
protection and power. The party seems interested in what the organization has to offer and agree to join.

The party are bound and blindfolded and walked to the hideout of this gang, which is in the tunnels under the town. When
they arrive at the hideout, they are given food and bunks, but locked in the room with the beds. Gizmo is taken to 
another room to be briefed on his curse.
