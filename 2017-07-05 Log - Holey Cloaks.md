# Holey Cloaks!

Frightened, the party feels trapped in a rough, upside down version of Harbour Town. They begin to investigate the
inverted buildings they are in. They pull up some floorboards and use them to make bridges between the windows in
adjacent buildings.

## Building equipment

In the neighbouring building to where they started, Kvothe discovers a pile of cloth in the attic. Carric maneuvers to
retrieve the fabric. Among some burlap tarps, they find a fine silken circle of fabric. They discover that it can act as
a portable hole that opens up to an extra-dimensional space.

They continue to investigate, now rummaging through piles of stone in the basement.

## Battle: Swarms of burrowing beetles

Their rummaging draws the attention of some burrowing beetles. After a squish fest, they decide not to linger and move
on to another adjacent building.

## Moldy beans

Inside the next house over, a yellow mold infestation has occurred. After some preparations, Candor sets the mold alight
which completely eliminates it. Hidden beneath the mold was a bag of strange looking beans, which the adventurers
pocket.

The party continues on to a large building across from the one they're in. It seems like above ground it would act as a
hotel, possibly like the apartments around the market square.

## Battle: Black pudding

As they investigate the hallways, they are attacked by a black pudding, which singes a hole through Candor's robes. They
flee the monster, but it pursues them in haste.

On the other side of this building is the equivalent of the market square, but instead of market stalls, there are 
scaffolds leading to a platform in the center of the square where the fountain would be.

Clambering up the scaffold, the party runs toward the platform. As the black pudding crosses the scaffold, Candor throws
a force bead to dislodge the walkway the monster is on. It falls and can be heard shredding on the stalagmites below.

## Surprise meeting

The battle with the pudding as aroused suspicion among the creatures working below. The party can't get to the platform
to escape without turning a bridge with some levers. From the platform they hear a familiar voice guide them how to get
across. Candor flips the levers appropriately and they cross to the circular platform to find Hornianus.

The platform begins to rise and they enter a cylindrical hole in the cave ceiling.
