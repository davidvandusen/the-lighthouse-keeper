# Sticky Situation

Gizmo, coming out of his first lycanthropic transformation is ready to accompany Power and Gavlan on a mission. They,
and Ranryn, are summoned by the Dachs, the werewolf that bit Gizmo and helped him learn to control his bloodlust. He
sends them on a mission to see whether some universal solvent can be found in the tunnels underneath the magic schools
in town.

The team goes to enter the tunnels with a plan for how they are going to navigate to the desired part of town.

## Battle: Giant rats

While investigating some areas of interest in the first parts of the tunnels, five giant rats attack the group. The rats
pose little threat, but indicate the dangers present in these tunnels. The investigation results in the discovery of a
small cache of seven miniature figurines in the shapes of the gods of the area.

## The snake and the hole

Slightly farther into the tunnels the party finds a large chamber that looks more frequently used. At its center is a
large cylindrical hole leading down. Its ceiling is held up by four large columns. At the bases of the columns are
piles of trash which the party roots through.

A poisonous snake jumps out of one of the piles but is caught by Gavlan, who decides to keep it for his own purposes.

## Drop box

As the group continues through the tunnels they find a mysterious box laying on the ground. It is locked by 7 latches,
but when all the latches are undone, the box does not open. Through the discovery of clues and Gizmo's brilliant ideas
they manage to get into the box. Inside is a short rod of metal whose ends act as buttons. When a button is depressed
the rod remains wherever it was in space for about 5 minutes before dropping to the ground.

## Between a rock and a swarm of stone eating fish

Further into the tunnels, there are some slippery wet stones leading to an upward pathway. The group climbs these stones
and are faced by a flowing river. On the other side is a floor and a doorway to more tunnels. The river is too far to
jump across, so a rope is fastened to the immovable rod and positioned to allow them to swing across.

## Battle: Giant crab and swarms of stone eating fish

The party takes pot shots at the swarms of fish in the water as the rope is being prepared. As they are doing this, a
giant crab sneaks up on them. The group has to swing across the river without falling in or be eaten by the fish. Gavlan 
takes out the crab and collects its claws. The rest dispose of the fish and collect a few to eat during a short rest.

## Battle: Crocodiles

As the party finish their short rest, they find that a pair of crocodiles have swum to eat some of the fish that the
party previously killed. Seeing the party as a better meal, the crocs attack. Rather than run, the party kills the 
crocs, but decide to immediately move onward.

## Blind to the invisible

Gavlan takes the lead and stumbles into a room that fills with blinding smoke. He gropes around and finds a secret door
that the party rushes through. In a hallway between the trapped room and another room, they party decides to rest.

## Battle: Gelatinous cube

As they rest, they notice the floor in this hallway is much cleaner than everywhere else they've been in the tunnels.
Then, a pile of trash mysteriously appears at the end of the hallway, but some of the trash appears to be floating in
midair.

Gizmo uses his mage hand to discover that it is a gelatinous cube closing in on them. They then fire everything they 
have at it as it closes in on them. It perishes moments before they would be forced back into the trapped room.

## Fluid thinking

In the room that the cube had approached them from there is one other door which is magically sealed. Across from the
door are three alcoves with plinths. On two of the plinths are jugs of liquid. On the fronts of the plinths are carved
scenes.

Remembering having seen a jug of some sort inside the gelatinous cube, the corpse of the jelly is searched. Gizmo finds
a spell scroll of blade ward. More importantly, though, a jug with many spouts is found.

Thanks to the identify spell, the party finds out that this is an alchemy jug, however it can only produce vinegar, 
honey, salt water, and mayonnaise. Through some investigation and thought, the party decides to pour liquids onto each
of the plinths, which ends up opening the magically sealed door.

Inside the room the party finds a few magical items, including a couple pinches of dust of drying, a potion of water
breathing, a folding boat in a box (that seems unable to assume its largest size), and a vial of universal solvent.

The hoard is taken down to the river, the boat is unfolded, and the group floats downstream toward the ocean.
