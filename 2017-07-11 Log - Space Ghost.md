Following the magical compass, the party continues climbing the mountainous island to its peak. On the peak are strange,
religious looking structures. Four long walls in the shape of a cross with a small pyramid in the center where the walls
intersect lay on a flat plateau.

Upon investigation, the  party finds some "working out" scratched into paving stones on the ground. The symbols written
are unfamiliar, even to Gizmo who uses comprehend languages on them. They are, however, strangely symmetrical, just like
the structures.

The two werewolves stand guard as the party investigates the inside of the pyramid.

## Battle: Ghost

After passing through a few passageways inside the structure, the party encounters a ghost. The ghost moves through the
strange magical space inside the pyramid, finding and losing the party. They are unable to get any meaningful 
information out of the ghost or to end its spiritual torment.

## Extracting the scepter

It is clear to the party that they must solve a puzzle to get to the inner chambers of the magical space inside the
pyramid. After much deliberation, and hopes beyond hope that the magical compass will continue to guide them, they find
the inner chambers of the pyramid where the magical item they'ce come to collect is kept.

The scepter that they've found cannot seem to be removed from the pyramid by any normal means, but as it turns out that
if several copies of it are removed simultaneously, one of them materializes on the outside.

## Splitting boat-ache

Now that the scepter has been extracted from the pyramid, the party hoofs it back to the ship. When they arrive back at
the shore they see in the distance a group of kuo-toa conducting some sort of ritual. Everyone hops in the folding boat
in order to quickly get back to the ship. As they row out from the shore, a bronze dragon swoops around the island,
lands on the ship, tears it into two halves. The party frantically rows back to shore, but Corgan and Dachs are too
frightened and jump out of the boat. The bronze dragon sees this, picks both of them up with its talons and flies back
over the island.

The party finds a safe place to set up camp in the forest and swears to kill every last kuo-toa on the island.
