# Log: The Pirates At Bay

The Lighthouse Keeper is quiet, as usual, around sundown on a mid-spring day. As is not unusual, a couple groups of
patrons arrive at dusk to have meetings of sorts. Inside the tavern, two shore workers sit separately at booths. Two
dwarfs in chain mail, a ranger and a fighter, sit with two stools between them at the bar. A group of five men with 
adventuring gear enter and head to a booth in the corner. They are followed by a group of three guild workers who are 
clearly trying to obscure their faces with hoods, who sit at another booth.

Across from the tavern at the pier, a tiefling sorcerer waves goodbye to his companions who are setting out on an 
adventure that will take them to a far off land. Noticing the interesting groups of people entering the Lighthouse 
Keeper, he disguises himself as a member of the hooded artisans, follows them in and sits with them at their table. 
They barely notice as they are wallowing in their self-pity with regard to their inability to protect their families 
from a threat that has recently come to town.

A gnome wizard enters after these groups and sits at the bar next to the less smelly of the dwarfs. He orders "the 
smallest biggest drink" that they serve, and is given strong ale in a teacup.

Outside of the tavern a half-elf fighter is walking by and is snapped out of his self-reflection by suspicious sounds 
that appear to be coming from behind the warehouses.

On a high hill outside of town, a half-elf druid is told by his owl companion that some unusual stirrings are taking
place in town. He heads down the hill toward the docks.

The half-elf fighter, his curiosity piqued, enters the Lighthouse Keeper to ask some questions to the barkeep. He sits
at the end of the bar and asks what kinds of activity go on in the alley behind the warehouses. The barkeep tells him
that there are often various kinds of cargo that are lugged by cart.

After a moment, a thud and scraping sound is heard at the back door to the tavern. Spurred by the dwarf fighter to look
into it, the barkeep goes to the back door, looks out, lets out a yelp, and immediately shuts the door. The dwarf
belligerently gets out of his seat and slams open the back door to shout at whomever startled the barkeep. He sees three
bandits hauling a tarp which is wrapped around some large lumpy payload and initiates a confrontation with them.

## Battle: Pirates!

A battle ensues with those three pirates, another two that came running back from further down the alley, and the pirate
captain. After killing the pirate captain as well as three of his crew, the tiefling diffuses the tension and invites 
one of the pirates into the tavern for a beer and a chat. The other pirate is left sleeping in the alley.

During the battle, the tiefling learned that the five adventurers at the table in the corner are patiently waiting for
someone and are reluctant to get involved in anything that is not of their concern. Also, he discovered that pirates are
the ones who had intimidated the guild workers, threatening them and their families if a shipment of weapons was not
given to them.

## Recruitment

In the tarp that the pirates were hauling was a man. He was abducted by the pirates, who were interested in being the
exclusive party who would be privy to the secret information that he had.

After some persuasion, the man says that he has come into town from Parnast to the east to recruit adventurers from the
Lighthouse Keeper. He showed a poster that contains a message from Veradda Stoor, requesting the help of treasure 
hunters to uncover the caches of riches that were hidden by the now defunct Cult of the Dragon. The poster contains a
map to a rendezvous point near Parnast where recruits are to meet Veradda in two days' time.

The poster is pocketed gleefully by the gnome.

The group shows interest in this adventure. The man that they saved is grateful for his life being saved, and pays for
each of the adventurers to stay at the inn at the Lighthouse Keeper overnight. He then retires to his own room to nurse
his bruises.
