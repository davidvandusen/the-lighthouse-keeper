# Log: Against the Frost

After resting outside the cave where the first treasure cache was, the party decides to go into the town of Parnast to 
acquire provisions before seeking out the other caches. Before they set off, they meet another traveler, a tiefling
sorcerer, who immediately hits it off with Candor.

The town doesn't have too much to offer, but they manage to sell the copper charms taken from Slayermighty for ten gold
per charm. After realizing that they are too poor to buy healing potions or horses, they decide to rest before going to
the third treasure cache.

They follow Veradda's notes to a steep ledge next to a tall mountain. The search the mountain and find two secret doors.
One door is hidden much better than the other, and they suspect the first door is trapped. Out of curiosity, Gavlan 
slowly pushes the trapped door and it shocks him and starts a rock slide. The party then hurries into the other door.

Wary of traps, the party investigates the tunnels of the cave they are now in. They are suspicious of the floor and 
carefully edge through the tunnels.

At the end of the winding tunnels, they find a room with an icy floor. Two giants lay dead in the middle of the room
having killed one another. A giant diamond on a pedestal is at the opposite end of the room.

Suspicious of the diamond, Carric looses an arrow at it. It starts to glow green and float in the air.

## Battle: Greed motes

Three party members &mdash; Candor, Gavlan, and Skathor, the newcomer &mdash; are struck by an overwhelming feeling of 
greed. Four glowing green masses start to attack the party. The greed motes seem resistant their attacks. Carric then
destroys the diamond with another arrow, and the motes quickly die.

## Stung by greed

After destroying the motes, the party members who were stung by greed struggle to overcome great psychic pain. Upon
relieving themselves of the immediate mental torment, they feel cursed. Until cured, these players will be stunned for
one round when in the presence of wealth in excess of 1000 gold.

## Where to next?

Potions of healing and pouches of 50 gold are found on both of the deceased giants. An envelope of diamond dust is 
collected by Carric where the diamond had shattered.

The party decides to sleep at the mouth of the cave before setting off to the east where the next treasure cache is.
