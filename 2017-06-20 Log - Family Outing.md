The party awake in the Zhentarim hideout. They are called on to do their first mission for the faction. Gizmo can't come 
because he's grappling with his curse. They are being sent to investigate why an order of magic items hasn't arrived 
from a wizard who lives in a protected wood two days to the south of the town.

Corgan, a werewolf with a fair amount of seniority in the organization, goes along with the party to guide them and 
ensure that they are being faithful to the faction.

When they arrive at the home of the wizard, they find that is has new tenants. A large, female ogre and her two 
half-ogre children are sleeping inside.

## Battle: All in the ogre family

The ogres are roused and go to attack the party. A few heavy blows are dealt, but thanks to their teamwork, they survive
a daunting battle.

## What's left

Now that the house is safe, they go in to investigate. One room is full of magical components and some half-finished
magical items. In the other room is a chest. Inside the chest is an object wrapped in leather. Corgan immediately takes
this and ignores the rest of the contents of the chest. He insists that this is the item that was ordered by The Mare
and he would see that it is brought to her. The party collects the remainder of the contents of the chest, including
some gems, a potion of frost giant strength, and a pair of sending stones.

- Experience for defeated enemies: 900 (divided by 3 adventurers, 300 each)
