# Setting: Harbour Town

![Harbour Town Sketch](2017-04-28%20Harbour%20Town%20Sketch.jpg)

Set on the northwest coast, Harbour Town acts as a port to far off lands across the sea. To the south are sparsely
populated lands that that deal in some trade, providing the residents of Harbour Town the yield of their farms in
exchange for crafted goods.

## Residents

The workers in Harbour Town are highly skilled craftspeople, and their knowledge is quite advanced. They fulfil orders
for weapons and armour that come across the sea from patrons in less tranquil lands. The ore and lumber that these
craftspeople use come from the mountains to the east of town.

## Districts

The town is divided roughly into districts. At the north end of town are wealthier residents. To the south of that is
the market square and guild workshops. At the south end of town are the warehouses and docks. Just outside of town to
the southeast are poorer residences.

### Wealthy District: Scholars

In the wealthy district live some scholars. They gain their wealth from dealing in trade across the sea, and use it to
to acquire books of arcana to teach themselves magic. At least a couple have set up schools adjacent to their homes to
encourage other scholars to come into town to share their wisdom.

### Wealthy District: Mayor

Also, in the wealthy district, lives the mayor. He has been mayor of this town for thirty years, and can't be bothered
to remember whether he was elected, or appointed, or came into the role by birthright. He is extremely busy dealing with
extra-municipal affairs, and is constantly surrounded by advisers and cronies, so it is nearly impossible to gain
audience with him.

### Market Square: The Tavern of the One Closed Eye

Near the market square is the Tavern of the One Closed Eye. Also known as "the Closed Eye", it is the more common of the
towns two public houses and fills to the brim when there is anything of note occurring in town.

### The Docks: The Lighthouse Keeper Inn and Tavern

Situated between two large warehouses at the docks is the Lighthouse Keeper Inn and Tavern. This is where shore workers
will come to drink in the evenings. Stranger folks might feel more comfortable at this tavern than at the Closed Eye, as
the establishment is more friendly to other races, vocations, and backgrounds.
