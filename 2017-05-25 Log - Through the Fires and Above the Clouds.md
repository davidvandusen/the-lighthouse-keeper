# Log: Through the Fires Continued

The party catches their breath and discusses a plan of attack for the monsters in the next room. Just then, Gavlan 
appears out of the smoke filled room, provoking attack.

## Battle: Magmin

The magmin put up a fight, and it takes the party some time to understand how to deal with them. Of primary concern is
that they explode when killed.

After destroying the two magmin that were already in the room, the smoke that was obscuring vision into the room
dissipates. The room is full of lava pits and a lava river. In the corner there is a symbol etched into the wall that
is flaring. Below it is a mound of what looks like pure silver.

As the party makes their way to investigate the symbol, it flares and another magmin emerges from the lava. Candor
recognizes this kind of magic and telepathically informs the party of what will need to be done in order to deactivate 
it.

Candor and Kvothe go to deal with the symbol while the rest of the party dispatches the new magmin. After marring,
and channelling magic into the symbol on the wall, they can sever the connection between the symbol and the silver.

## Spoiled with silver

The party searches the now safe room. Three members find topaz gems among the rubble. The giant mound of silver is
divided and carried off by the adventurers.

## Rewards

- Experience for defeated enemies: 300 (divided by 4 adventurers, 75 each)
- Experience for deactivating the magic symbol: 25 each
- Spoils: 3 topaz, melted silver
- Gold: none
- Downtime days: 2.5

# Log: Above the Clouds

When the party exits the mountain, they see Carric awaiting them on the road. He seems to have recovered from his shock
of receiving magical powers and joins the party as they decide to go to the final cache at the summit of the tallest
peak of the mountains. The ascent begins near to where they are.

It takes a day and a half to scale the mountain. When the adventurers reach the peak, they are above the clouds, which
the sun is illuminating in brilliant yellows and oranges. At the end of the path there is a large metal bell hanging.

## Battle: Giant owls

As they are admiring the view, four giant owls swoop out of the clouds and attack the party. During the battle, 
Carric decides to shoot an arrow at the bell. A powerful wave of thunder magic emanates from it, shocking the players.
Despite this, they go on to defeat the owls. Then they approach the bell.

## Chiming in

On the bell is a riddle, which Gizmo solves with ease, revealing the entry passage to the mountain shrine. The party
enters to find a room with four large braziers and a huge stone slab laid with a cloth.

## Battle: Ice and steam mephits

As they approach the slab, the braziers light up and two ice mephits emerge. When the party have shattered the ice
mephits, the ice of their bodies reform into steam mephits. The steam mephits are not particularly offensive in melee,
but absorb fire, convincing Candor to retreat. Kvothe has gotten the idea in his head to light the cloth draped on the
stone slab on fire, to little effect. 

Candor climbs up on the stone slab as the steam mephits are being dealt with and finds four large gold plates. Also, a
pile of dead bodies are heaped behind the stone slab.

## A giant fib

When the room finally appears safe, Gizmo searches the bodies behind the stone slab. They appear to be members of the
Cult of the Dragon, and have on their bodies 200 gold worth of coins, jewels, and other valuables, which are divided
among the party.

The cloth on the stone slab is no longer on fire. Candor investigates the plates, and upon determining it is safe to
move them, throws them down to Gavlan.

As they go to exit the shrine, their way is stopped by the biggest storm giant they could imagine. He informs them that
he is Kraddokk and came to investigate news that this shrine was desecrated a few days ago. He notices the burned cloth
and plates being carried by Gavlan. The party ensures him that they are only there to return the plates, not to take
them. Convinced of this, Kraddokk takes the plates and places them back on the stone slab. He offers them six potions
of healing and safe passage out of the shrine. He also tells the adventurers he'll put in a good word for them with the
storm giants for their service.

- Experience for solving the bell riddle: 25 each
