# Searching for Something

The morning after the lycanthrope attack at the inn, Kvothe takes Carric and Candor to investigate the scene after 
picking up their silvered weapons from the weapon smiths. They do these things quick because Candor has secured and 
audience with the mayor that evening.

When they arrive at the inn they find it completely empty. Upon snooping around they find a pair of wax seals with very
slightly different insignia on them. They take imprints of these.

The innkeeper arrives back, and says to Kvothe that he had gone to the authorities to advise them of the attack. The 
other party members are in hiding and go to sneak out through the underground passageway under the inn.

## The mayor's digs

To prepare for their audience with the mayor, the party goes to secure more appropriate clothing for the meeting. Candor
manages to bargain a deal for clothing for Kvothe and Carric.

They go to meet their contact in front of the mayor's manor, and he takes them inside. They are taken to a large room
wherein the mayor and several armed guards are. The conversation with the mayor reveals little, but he seems slightly
disturbed by what the party has revealed. He then "invites" the party to stay at the manor until the next day, when they
can converse some more.

## Some hospitality

The group are escorted to a room with three beds and stone walls except for a slit for a window. The door is locked
behind them.

Later, their contact is allowed to enter the room to bring them some meager food. He says that he works for the Harpers,
that he knows of the Zhentarim, that the inn keeper is a spy for the Harpers who is working to know who the Zhentarim
are recruiting, and that he can help the party escape.

The party hear this and say they'll decide what to do in the morning. Kvothe is worried that their companions didn't
survive the attack at the inn, so he transforms and escapes through the window to see if he can find out if they're 
still alive.
